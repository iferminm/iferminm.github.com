                       <ul>
                           <li>either it is underutilizing the warehouse,</li> 
                           <li>or it is over-utilizing it.</li>
                       </ul>

                       <p>In the case of underutilization, a company may own or rent a 1000 square meter facility but only be utilizing about 700 square meters, and simply keeps the rest for future growth, this is a significant opportunity cost and represents wasted capital. In the case of over-utilization, a company may own or rent a 1000 square meter facility but has already outstripped its capacity which leads to record loss or damage, the only way to remedy this situation is to invest in a new facility which means searching, buying, building, and moving, a huge expense.</p>

                       <p>At Menafile you only pay for exactly what you use, i.e. the client is charged per box, per month;</p>

Our advanced software is able to track the file required instantaneously, if the client requires the original file it can be sent within the hour, by the end of the business day, or by the beginning of the next business day depending on urgency. Alternatively, if it is not confidential, the particular record within the file can be faxed, or scanned and sent to the client’s e-mail inbox.</p>
