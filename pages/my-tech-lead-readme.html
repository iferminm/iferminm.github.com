    <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Hola, I'm Israel, as your Tech Lead, I look forward to getting to know you more through conversations and interactions. 
To give you a head start in knowing me I'd like to share my management style, philosophy, expectations and some information about myself.</p>
<p>This is a living document, which will change. Please let me know if you have any feedback on how to make this more useful to you and the team.</p>
<h2>My Job</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide context</li>
<li>Help you grow in every dimension you think I can help</li>
<li>Engage, retain, and grow world-class talent (that's you!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm here to <strong>help</strong>, <strong>empower</strong> and <strong>support you</strong>, to set context for what you're working on, and to <strong>advocate</strong> for <strong>you</strong> 
and <strong>the team</strong> with the rest of the company.</p>
<h2>Leadership Style</h2>
<p>I'm a believer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership">Servant Leadership</a>. I serve you, not the other way around, 
we work together to solve the challenges the organization present us. I'm always available to assist. Ask me.</p>
<p>You work for the <em>Careem</em>, not for me. Optimize for the company, build for the company and always act on Careem's best interest, not mine. 
In the end, I'm human I'll make mistakes and I want to improve, just like you. Hold me accountable, tell me and always give feedback.</p>
<h2>My Availability</h2>
<p>I always have some events on my Calendar, however you are always welcome and encouraged to drop me a meeting invite, 
you don't need to ask first.</p>
<p>If you want or need to talk to me, and my schedule is not open, DM me on Slack and I'll make time, if there's anything you need
or want to talk about, let's make it happen.</p>
<h2>Process and Software Development</h2>
<p>People build software, not the other way around. As such I prefer to adjust process to meet the needs 
and goals of our people. This frees us to do our best work for the company we work for. At the end of the day, 
this is what I value:</p>
<ul>
<li>I value <strong>transparency</strong> about what happened, what's happening, and what's going to happen. Always the truth, I never hide mistakes
and no one should.</li>
<li>I value <strong>growth</strong> and <strong>learning</strong>. Fail fast and learn. Experiment with clear goals and tight feedback loops. 
Help others learn by sharing your own journey (success and fail stories) and keeping a low ego.</li>
<li>I value <strong>your time</strong> and will do my best to ensure it is not wasted. I expect the same from you. I don't want you 
to do any process that is neither beneficial to you nor required by law, policy, etc. We need to be productive and think long term</li>
<li>I value <strong>proactivity</strong> and <strong>self-organization</strong>. I have no desire to make every decision myself, I'm sure you don't want me to either.
You are the master of your time, you decide how to invest it, in the end we only care about results.</li>
<li>I value <strong>stability</strong> and <strong>consistency</strong>.</li>
<li>I value <strong>critical thinking</strong>. Nothing is sacred and we don't do anything <em>because we've always done it that way</em>, there's always 
a better way, a better practice and a better tool, let's choose the best ones to do the job.</li>
<li>I value <strong>intentionality</strong>, we have too much to do for any of it to be random.</li>
<li>I value <strong>empathy</strong>. Having empathy for your co-workers will help us to build stronger teams and stronger relationships.</li>
<li>I value <strong>simplicity</strong>, complex solutions often lead to complex problems. If something is hard to explain, then it's a bad idea,
on the other hand, if something is easy to explain, it might be a good idea</li>
</ul>
<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>I will work to be as open as possible about what's going on with our projects, team, department, and the company. 
You can ask me anything. The vast majority of the time I'll answer. Very infrequently (hopefully), I won't be able to. 
But I'm committed to never lying to you.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>More than any other factor, <strong>candid</strong> and <strong>compassionate</strong> feedback is central to a cohesive <strong>high-functioning</strong> team.</p>
<p>I prefer to receive <strong>direct</strong> feedback. I'm <strong>committed</strong> to <strong>providing</strong> you clear and timely feedback, 
and I'd love it if you did the same for me.</p>
<p>Three dimensions are required for people to continue to give you feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety:</strong> unlikelihood of being punished for giving feedback; should be <strong>high</strong></li>
<li><strong>Effort:</strong> the amount of work in order to give feedback, also known as "how much do you argue when people give you feedback?"; 
should be <strong>low</strong></li>
<li><strong>Benefit:</strong> how likely is it that giving you feedback will materially impact your behavior? should be <strong>high</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if I don't do well on any of these three dimensions.</p>
<h2>1:1 Meetings</h2>
<p>These meetings are for you and the agenda is what you make it. What is it you'd like to talk to me about? 
What's exciting you? What's frustrating you? What could I do today that would make you happier or more productive? 
We don't need to talk about project status in this meeting, unless you want to. I'll ask questions and provide 
feedback along the way, but this is your time.</p>
<p>The length, frequency, and medium are also up to you, although if you're on a <em>Mountain Peak</em> most likely will happen over Zoom. 
My hope is that we'll have at least 30 minutes each other week. This is only a minimum though, and not a maximum.</p>
<h2>Work/Life Balance.</h2>
<p>I value work/life balance in my own life and yours. Most folks work between about 9:30am (at the earliest) to 6pm (at the latest), 
and unless there's an emergency, I don't expect to communicate with you outside of these hours with respect to your local time. 
I try not to respond to e-mails or slack during off-hours and under no circumstances expect you to, unless it's an emergency.</p>
<p>Personally, I usually work from ~9:00 to ~18:00 and sometimes, only sometimes, again from ~22:30 to ~00:00. So, if you get a late night
email from me, it shouldn't be taken as <em>Israel is being annoying, I need to reply</em>, it's more like <em>Oh, Israel will need this tomorrow, 
let's reply tomorrow</em>, if there's an emergency and I need a reply, the <em>Subject</em> will include something like <strong>URGENT</strong> and will most likely
be followed by a phone call.</p>
<p>I will never bother you out of working hours unless I <strong>really really</strong> need you.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Your Philosophies</h2>
<p>I've written a lot here about my philosophies but a fair amount of my job is adapting to your needs and philosophies, 
and I look forward to talk to you about them!</p>
