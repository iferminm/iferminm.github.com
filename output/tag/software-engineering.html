</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>On a <a href="http://iffm.me/my-take-on-microservices.html">previous article</a> on <em>microservices</em>, we went through the best practices I've seen,
which doesn't mean those are the only ones, it only means that those are the ones I've seen work for me
and the ones I've tried.</p>
<p>This time, I would like to focus on <strong>Choreography over Orchestration</strong> and <strong>Rely on data, not services</strong> because
I feel I didn't develop enough on these ones and those are really important these are also the two <em>principles</em> 
that will help you <em>avoid sync calls</em>, which is usually a good practice for inter-service communication.</p>
<p>But first:</p>
<h2>Internal <em>REST</em> services, why not?</h2>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love <em>REST</em>, I like building <em>API</em>s and I enjoy using a well designed one for sure, but for internal
communication I prefer to avoid it unless the communication <strong>needs</strong> to be synchronous, there are some cases where you can't
help it and it's not always because of a bad design, sometimes the use case itself enforces that restriction.</p>
<p>If you find yourself using network calls most of the time, something will most likely go wrong. Network is not 100% reliable
and, <strong>always</strong> remember, <em>if something can fail, it will fail</em>.</p>
<h3>Increases overall response time</h3>
<p>Take a look at the following figure: </p>
<p><img alt="Services map" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k261ik209fporvr/service_down.png"></p>
<p>Response times are not taking into account the wait time while the downstream services
respond. This means, <em>service 1</em> queries <em>service 2</em>, it does <em>something</em> and takes 10ms to respond. Also, <em>Service 1</em> queries
<em>Service 3</em> which queries <em>Service 4</em> and <em>Service 5</em>. <em>Service 4</em> does <em>something</em> and takes 300ms to respond and <em>Service 5</em>
queries <em>Service 6</em> which takes 1000ms to respond, then <em>Service 5</em> does <em>something</em> and takes another 1200ms to come back to
<em>Service 3</em>, which has been waiting 2200ms to get all the data it needs to do <em>some stuff</em> which takes 300ms. By this time,
<em>Service 1</em> has been waiting 2500ms for all the data it needs to do a 120ms <em>something</em> and return back to the upstream caller,
which could be another service waiting or the end user. </p>
<p>Note that the above flow paralelizes all the needed downstream calls per service, so in this case, the total response time will be
constrained by the slowest call chain. If you were using a stack where doing multiprocessing or async programming is not an easy
option, you'll have to add up the response time for all of the downstream calls because in reality the service in question
is being blocked while waiting for the network call to finish and, only then, making the second call and blocking until it comes back
and so on.</p>
<p>There are several ways you can keep the same setup, you can add several levels of cache in between services, you can add a timeout
to the network calls but everything comes at a cost. If you're keeping a synchronous approach to answer certain questions it's because
you need your data as fresh as possible, so, the more cache you add the more stale your data could be. You could also add a timeout to
your calls but, if one of them times out, you'll fail in responding to the upstream caller and it will look like the system is down.</p>
<h3>What if someone is down?</h3>
<p>Let imagine <em>Service 6</em> is down because we had a buggy release.</p>
<p>This means, <em>Service 1</em> will have to wait 1500ms before returning an error upstream, you can mitigate this
with a <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html">circuit breaker</a> approach or returning a 
cached response for the query you're trying to answer but,
again, unless you really need this to be synchronous, you'd be adding more complexity to an already complex
system.</p>
<p>Also, what if it isn't a <em>read</em> operation, what if we're actually <em>writing</em> downstream and the last write fails
because of <em>reasons</em>. You'll be half way a transaction and you'll have to deal with it somehow, either queuing that
last write and hoping <em>Service 6</em> comes back soon or rolling back the whole transaction which would mean deleting from
the other services and returning an error, there are ways to solve this, but usually it doesn't need to be this hard.</p>
<h3>When should I go synchronous?</h3>
<p>In my opinion, it will depend on the use case you're implementing and how critical it is to
return the exact data at the moment the request was done, usually there's some tolerance to
return slightly stale data, but things like <em>credit accounting</em>, <em>warehouse availability</em> or
anything that was to do with resources being consumed in real time are good candidates for
sync calls and all the complexity they involve.</p>
<h2>Choreography vs Orchestration</h2>
<p>There's a good analogy in the <em>microservices</em> world and how they handle <em>things</em> happening
within the system, let's call those things <em>events</em>.</p>
<p>Let's say there are two types of <em>events</em>, those which make the system <em>do</em> something, for example,
in an e-commerce website it could be a user bought something, and those which make the system <em>change</em>
its status, for example, update some records in the database o send a request to another service. The
first ones, let's call them <em>external events</em> because they're triggered by an external actor, maybe the
user or an external system consuming our API, these <em>external events</em> are the ones triggering the second
ones, let's call them <em>internal events</em> because it's the system updating itself. So, <em>external events</em> trigger
<em>internal events</em>.</p>
<p>Now, there are two ways of handling <em>events</em>, we can either do it via <em>orchestration</em>, where we have
a service which acts as the <em>master</em> of the transaction, telling all the other services involved in it
what to do, what to update. Just like a Conductor does in an Orchestra, it tells all the other musicians
(services) when to play they part, how to play it and so on. The other way is more like a <em>choreography</em>,
where given an <em>event</em> every service knows how to handle it and how to react to it, just like dancers who
know how and where to move or what do do when a certain part of the song is played.</p>
<p>Good architectures are a mix of both approaches and good architects know when to use either of those
depending on the business needs and the use case they're modeling. Unfortunately there's no recipe
to decide, gaining experience designing systems and making mistakes are the only way to learn, although
reading about others experience, having clear concepts on how distributed systems and networks work and
a good understanding of the problem at hand we're solving are a good starting point.</p>
<h2>Rely on data, not services</h2>
<p>We spoke about <em>low coupling and high cohesion</em> in <em>microservices</em> in a previous article, relying on
a service to be up in order for some other service to be able to do what it's supposed to do is some
form of <em>coupling</em>, you are letting an independent system fail because another is feeling unwell.</p>
<p>For services to be independent, every service should have a copy of the data they need to answer at least
basic queries, this doesn't mean you'll directly update the copies, you need to define which service is going
to be your <em>source of truth</em> for a specific piece of data and perform all the write operations for it to <strong>that</strong>
service and then, somehow, update the copies. You can rely on <em>internal events</em> to do this, every time an
<em>external event</em> triggers an update on the <em>source of truth</em> for a give piece of data, you can fire up
an <em>internal event</em> to make the services keeping a copy update their local copies.</p>
<p>By doing this you can still serve a read-only version of the data for some use cases even if the source of
truth is down, if it's, for example, an e-commerce and the source of truth for the catalog is, for example,
the <em>Inventory Service</em>, you can still serve the catalog even though the users won't be able to purchase
anything, they still can save them to their <em>wishlist</em> and browse the website, this lets you gracefully
degrade your system if there are problems with some services, you just show an error message or hide the options
or have alternate workflows until the systems supporting the degraded use case are back up and running.</p>
<p>What if a service is down and misses some updates from the source of truth?, well, depending on how you propagate
the updates, you can do several things. You can use a queuing system like <em>ZeroMQ</em> or <em>RabbitMQ</em> to propagate
the updates, so, if a service is down, the updates will be waiting on the queue to be consumed once the service
is up, if you're using HTTP calls, you can have your worker retry the failed requests after a <em>back-off</em> time or
write the payload to a given location so, when the other service comes up, an <em>init</em> script checks that location,
reads whatever is there and marks those messages as <em>consumed</em>, there are multiple ways to deal with this problem,
most of them will depend on the technology you're using.</p>
<h3>Eventual consistency</h3>
<p>When you deal with distributed systems and distributed information, chances are, some copies will be stalled
for a period of time, this means, information will always be flowing through the <em>pipes</em> of your system, the only
way you will have total consistency is if you stop writing and wait some time. Even in monolithic systems, what you
show to the user is stale most of the time, let's say, for example, a website listing used articles for sale, when
the search page is served to the user, depending on the traffic, there will be probably 10ths or hundreds of new
articles the user won't see unless they refresh the page or we have a pushing mechanism in place. So, how important is
it really to show the most updated information available to the user?, truth is, is not that critical in most cases.</p>
<p>For building reports though, you should always query from your sources of truth, this could be tricky on a distributed
system where your source of truth varies depending on the information you're looking for and it's not a single database
where you can run a SQL query and join everything together. You could rely also on <em>internal events</em> to build a reporting
database while the relevant events are happening instead of querying everything when a report is requested, this way you'll
always have relevant business data to produce reports on top of.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There's no silver bullet to solve the problems that come with distributed computing, however, there are strategies
to help you discover the best way to deal with certain problems for your specific use case, try to use choreography
where possible and orchestrate the flows that need to be completely synchronous, always try to find the easiest solution,
keep in mind that sometimes the easiest way to solve a problem is the hardest to implement, but benefits will be seen
in the future, when you need to debug a failure or scale, or even extend your system with more features or plugging more
microservices in.</p>
<p>Also, always prefer choreography and async communication when possible instead of orchestration and sync calls between
services, this doesn't mean you should avoid it at all cost as there are use cases that need that approach. A good architect
knows that the best way to solve a problem is not following strictly one and only one approach, it's combining different
concepts and ways around it and adapting them to the specific problem to achieve an efficient and elegant solution. </p>
