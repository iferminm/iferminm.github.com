with the rest of the team more often. Of course, we do code reviews and
we have some other ways to get the knowledge spread across the team, we have
a wiki on confluence, we have tech meetings where we talk about how we will
solve the problems at hand, those are good opportunities for very specific
knowledge sharing, which would be in the form of advice or guidance on the
approach to follow to implement something, but it would be nice to have
some other kind of sessions to keep the team motivated, active and seeing
each other while the lockdown lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought of several topics I could talk about, all technical ones:
DevOps, Distributed Systems, Functional Programming, very exciting ones
but then I realized, the team is very very good technically, everyone is
a very capable &lt;em&gt;programmer&lt;/em&gt;, and then I stopped. See, I said &lt;em&gt;programmer&lt;/em&gt;,
is that what we are?, nope, definitely not. The job title says &lt;strong&gt;Software
Engineer&lt;/strong&gt;, is that all we do? write code?, I don't think so. I started writing
my thoughts and put them together in the form of a talk I'll summarize in this blog
post. Thinking about it, most of us don't realize the complexity around
&lt;strong&gt;Software Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; and we minimize our work to &lt;em&gt;yeah, I write code and
stuff&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;I maintain and implement new features&lt;/em&gt; but everything is much more
complex than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Programmer vs Developer vs Engineer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't misunderstand me, there are plenty of roles our there and we call ourselves
in many ways: &lt;em&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Software Developer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Programmer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Computer
Programmer&lt;/em&gt; but words have an impact and everything has a meaning, I believe
we should name things correctly. I'm not asking everyone to think or name things the same
as I do, but I do think we should separate things and roles in a better way and with
different expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Programmer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programmer is someone who writes code, that's it, a programmer wouldn't care
too much about Software Architecture or Design, neither about the whole lifestyle.
A programmer gets the full spec of what they need to implement, they write the code
and they deliver it, not much thoughts about how it's going to be deployed, where it's
going to run or how it's going to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Developer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A software developer will care about the software, a bit of design and architecture
but that's it, not much interest in where it's going to be deployed, how it's going to
run or how it's going to be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying all programmer or developers are like that, I'm just saying these should be
the concerns of those roles. If you consider yourself a Programmer or a Developer and you go
beyond that, great!, now, the whole point of this article is to share my views and definition
about the &lt;strong&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/strong&gt; role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Software Engineer&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Software Engineer, just like a Programmer and Developer, they care about Software,
they also write code and make sure it works as expected but also worry about design,
architecture and implementing best practices on every aspect about software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building:&lt;/strong&gt; as a Software Engineer, we worry about building good software, not only
about the software itself, we worry about the building blocks, choosing (or building) the 
correct ones, implementing the right levels of abstraction so that maintainability is
easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating:&lt;/strong&gt; as a Software Engineer, we know we don't have to always build something
new, we can just run existing software and operate it, monitor, manage and make sure
it runs smoothly so that every user can accomplish their goals with it. Also, we know that
the software we build needs to be operated by someone (sometimes ourselves) so we need to build
ways to interface and interact with it from an admin perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a usually forgotten one, we read ridiculous amounts of manuals and
other types of documentation and interpret them in order to use third party software, but we also
need to write docs in order for other to use our software or understand and contribute to our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We know about software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we need to know a lot about it, not only to write it, but also to use it effectively, when building
it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to be well done:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about architecture, design and making the right decisions
from the ground up: choosing the right stack, building the right abstractions and applying the best
practices we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to be operable:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about things like CICD, monitoring, logging. Building it
in a way so that it is easy to debug and find issues while running on production as well as building ways
to interact with it to gather information, metrics or reports via command line if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to work:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about testing and verification so that the behavior of the systems
we build is predictable, injective and idempotent. For a set of inputs, the output is something we expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We know around software&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We not only know how to build software, we also know many things around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to run somewhere:&lt;/strong&gt; so we know about infrastructure and operating systems, but we're not
sysadmins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it talks to other software:&lt;/strong&gt; so we know about network and communication protocols as well as
distributed systems, but we're not network engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to store data somewhere:&lt;/strong&gt; so we know about databases and data modeling, we have to do it
efficiently and we have to know how to tune performance if needed, but we're not sysadmins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We know it has to function in a certain way:&lt;/strong&gt; so we worry about testing at several levels and of different kind:
performance, unit testing, integration, UX and UI testing, API tests. But we're not QA engineers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We are part of a team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I mentioned before is very difficult and complex and, to add to that, we need to work with other humans,
we are part of a team which usually has people from diverse backgrounds and specialties, a (sometimes non technical)
Product or Project Manager, an Engineering Manager, some front end engineers, QA specialists and so on, we need to
communicate in different ways and keep everyone aligned on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meetings:&lt;/strong&gt; we need to attend meetings in order to brief about the technicalities if the work being done
and unblock if someone needs help with something we know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation:&lt;/strong&gt; this comes in many forms, technical specs, API documentation, all of this is, at the end of the day,
communication that needs to flow constantly, just that we choose to store it in the form of text to that we don't have
to repeat ourselves every time when someone needs to use the API or go through how something was implemented and the thought
process behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Review:&lt;/strong&gt; this is a good one, this is when we get to mentor people and help them get their work into a better shape,
also when we get help to improve ours and learn from others, this is also another form of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Communication is everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not taking anything from this post, the only thing I'd like you to think about is that, yes, hard skills are very important
for the Software Engineering role, we need to think about how we write code that performs better, but none of that is useful if we are unable
to work with others. To work with others, communication is everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't assume the people you're talking to knows or has the same context you have, always start by sharing the contextual information
needed to understand the problem at hand or the solution you'll present&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know your audience, it's not like you're performing a stand-up comedy routine but, when you're communicating, you do have an audience,
setting the tone and language is important, it's not the same talking (or writing for) API users than writing (or talking) to someone
whose code you're reviewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always ask, you never know if the others are assuming some context, the only way to find out is asking. When something is not clear
or you find yourself assuming something, that's when you need to ask. You can ask a question because you don't know something or a
clarifying question, which might seem redundant, just to make sure everyone is on the same page and getting the same understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you realize you don't know it all and you don't have to know everything, you also realize the rest of the people
also don't know everything, and they also don't have to know it all, everyone comes from different backgrounds and knows some things
they've been exposed to or studied and ignore some others. Only by talking to each other, communicating and sharing knowledge we all
become stronger engineers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="software engineering"></category></entry><entry><title>Bye bye dubizzle, hello Careem!</title><link href="http://iffm.me/bye-bye-dubizzle-hello-careem.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-30T00:00:00+04:00</published><updated>2018-03-30T00:00:00+04:00</updated><author><name>Israel Fermín Montilla</name></author><id>tag:iffm.me,2018-03-30:/bye-bye-dubizzle-hello-careem.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been quiet for the last two months, I was a bit busy switching jobs, yes,

after more than three years I decided to leave &lt;em&gt;dubizzle&lt;/em&gt;, part of the &lt;em&gt;OLX&lt;/em&gt;
group and one of the biggest brands here in the United Arab Emirates, for reasons
I won't discuss in this post and some reasons I'll expose here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend &lt;a href="http://gerardobarcia.com/blog/"&gt;Gerardo Barcia&lt;/a&gt; used to quote a lot
a phrase which author I don't know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is the only constant in our lives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked that, I like to think that one needs to come out of your comfort zone from time
to time as the only way to evolve as a professional and as a human being, when change
comes to you constantly, you're done, when you can seek change easily it's also good,
you learn, you innovate, you become better you put that brain to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was one &lt;em&gt;the thing&lt;/em&gt; I loved about working at &lt;em&gt;dubizzle&lt;/em&gt;, it was dynamic, I got
to work on interesting projects, I got to challenge myself and it was &lt;strong&gt;GREAT!!&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what happened or when, but things became just &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;meh&lt;/strong&gt;, everything
slowed down and I didn't feel challenged anymore, in fact, I felt like I was solving the
same problem over and over and over again, I simply stopped having fun, the projects
I was working on didn't motivate me and I wasn't feeling I was having a positive impact
anymore, so, change didn't come to me, so I started looking for change, trying to be
moved to a different department or a different role and finding a lot of resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you stop enjoying something, you should stop doing it and that was exactly what happened,
I stopped enjoying my job at &lt;em&gt;dubizzle&lt;/em&gt;, for several reasons but I believe this one was
the most important one, so I decided to move on. Here in the UAE, there are several big
players in the tech scene: &lt;em&gt;dubizzle&lt;/em&gt; is one of them but not the only one, there's also
&lt;em&gt;Souq&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Namshi&lt;/em&gt; which are e-commerce websites, &lt;em&gt;Fetchr&lt;/em&gt; which is a delivery company and
&lt;em&gt;Careem&lt;/em&gt; which is a ride-hailing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I interviewed with several but I wanted to do
something different, I was into classifieds for too long and e-commerce I don't think is
that different, so, when the decision came down to &lt;em&gt;Fetchr&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Careem&lt;/em&gt;, I started digging
deeper into both companies and there was one talk by one of &lt;em&gt;Careem&lt;/em&gt; co-founders, Magnus Olsson,
that made me think, well &lt;em&gt;Fetchr&lt;/em&gt; looks like a great company, also &lt;em&gt;Careem&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;Careem&lt;/em&gt;
has this guy with this amazing story and the will to do something meaningful and you can
see that even in the name of the company, &lt;em&gt;Careem&lt;/em&gt; means &lt;em&gt;generosity&lt;/em&gt; in Arabic language.
So, here I am, being Careem at &lt;em&gt;Careem&lt;/em&gt; and helping &lt;em&gt;improve the people's lives and
build an organization that inspires&lt;/em&gt; one line at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Recommended:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrSYYmaKmmo"&gt;The video&lt;/a&gt; that made me join &lt;a href="https://careem.com"&gt;Careem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Dubizzle-EI_IE670451.11,19.htm"&gt;dubizzle in Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; looks like a lot of people are not happy, I hope they course correct before it's too late&lt;/li&gt;

and archiving old stuff and, I must say: what the hell did I have in my head by that time?, for real, there are
things that are over-engineered, very complicated solutions to simple problems, sub-optimal or inefficient code,
a lot of spaghetti code, highly coupled modules (or django apps), all of this to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, maybe, in a couple of months (or years) I'll go through the code I wrote today, or yesterday and say the
same thing &lt;em&gt;oh my god! was I stupid or what?&lt;/em&gt;, but I believe this is part of every craftsmanship job like software
engineering, graphic design, cooking and even music. You come out of school with the knowledge, but only experience
doing what you're trained to do will give you elegant practices and make you a good professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to evolve is to &lt;strong&gt;never stop learning&lt;/strong&gt;, read a lot of technical stuff, also master your &lt;strong&gt;soft skills&lt;/strong&gt;,
I wrote it bold because they're as important as your technical ones, try out new ways of doing things, programming
paradigms, new programming languages, new tools to add to your stack and adopt better practices or ease some
pains in your development, testing or deploy process, perhaps your company's or your employer's processes. Only by
learning and gaining knowledge and then putting it in practice you will gain experience and know what works, what doesn't
work and what work betters under some conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice.
— Anton Chekhov&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be asking what made me reflect on this, well, some time ago I wrote about &lt;a href="the-evilness-of-none.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The evilness of None&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
how it is a bad practice to &lt;code&gt;return None&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;return null&lt;/code&gt; from functions when you're expecting the output to meet
certain requirements (internal link). Since I wrote that, I've been going through old projects checking how common
this pattern was on my code and, unsurprisingly, I found some other bad practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if checking old code and surprising myself with &lt;em&gt;how stupid I was&lt;/em&gt; is something that happens often, it is a good
thing, it means I've learned something I didn't know by the time I wrote that code. So, always move forward but,
from time to time, check backwards not to adopt bad old habits, but to see how much you've learned and also if there's
anything you need to fix on a project you're maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="software engineering"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="personal"></category></entry><entry><title>Working at dubizzle</title><link href="http://iffm.me/working-at-dubizzle.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-08-16T00:00:00+04:00</published><updated>2017-08-16T00:00:00+04:00</updated><author><name>Israel Fermín Montilla</name></author><id>tag:iffm.me,2017-08-16:/working-at-dubizzle.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;About 4 years ago I got an email through StackOverflow Careers from a woman called

Claudia Verlinden, a very nice Belgian lady who happened to be an HR Manager at a company
in the middle east and she was looking for Software Engineers with experience in Python and
django, so, she asked me if I was interested in applying to one of their open positions
in their Engineering team, I said yes and 2 months later I was boarding a plane and landing
in Dubai, yes Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Dubai experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of taboo in the west side of the world about the Middle East region, specially
about Arabs, Muslims and Islam in general, they speak a lot about terrorism and how everyone
in the Middle East is a potential terrorist, how Arabs have no sense of humor and they're angry
all the time. Well, I'm here to tell you that none of that is true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, after living almost 4 years in Dubai, a Muslim country, my experience had been nothing
but positive from almost every perspective (still don't like the weather in August), there's
people from everywhere in the world, from countries I didn't know were countries and you get
to see people whose countries had been in war, working together like the best friends in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai is one of the safest cities in the world and for me, coming from Caracas, one of the
most violent cities in the world, that's very important. You'll never see a gun if it isn't on
a Policeman's belt, no one will break into your house or car to take that cellphone you left there
or that purse with your documents in the back seat, more important, if you leave something at some
place, even in the street, there's a high chance it will still be there when you're back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife has left her iPhone in restaurants, hospitals and stores more times than I can remember and each and
every time we got it back the same day, they even called me once to tell me "hey, I believe someone you
know left her phone in my store, it's a pink iPhone, anyone you know has a pink iPhone with a Hello Kitty
cover?", yes... that's my wife's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the heat in summer, which can reach over 50C by August, there are a lot of things to do as a single
or with your family, museums, restaurants, bars, beaches, hiking, desert camping and BBQ, you name it, even
indoors Skying at Sky Dubai in Mall of the Emirates. I'm a declared foodie (I married a chef), and one of
the things I like the most is the huge variety of gastronomy you can find, from Arabic to Russian food, American
burger joints, Asian Cuisine and even Latin restaurants, some Peruvian, Colombian, Argentinean and there's even a Food Truck
serving Arepas and a lot of Venezuelan stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arabs have such an amazing sense of humor, they even joke about bombs and having terrorist cousins,
they get American jokes and they like Jeff Dunham!, they're pretty much like Latinos, they like to
laugh a lot and they're loyal friends, if they can help you in any way, you can be certain they will.
But it needs to work the other way around as well, if they need your help, they will expect you to
help them if it's on your hands, but that's what friendship should be about, right?, relying on each
other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I realized when I moved here is that not all Arabs are Muslims and not all Muslims are Arabs,
Islam is a wide spread religion in this region, so most Pakistanis, some Indians, also some Filipinos,
Bosnian, and people from the *stan countries are Muslims and they're not Arabs, but also there are a lot
of Catholics and Christians in Lebanon, which is an Arab country, and also in India and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UAE, and specially Dubai is super liberal to be an Islamic country, you get to see everything, from women
wearing the traditional Abaya and Niqab or Hijab, to women wearing &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; nothing and people is ok with
that. Alcohol is forbidden in Islam, so, it's a bit harder to get, which doesn't mean is hard. Only Muslims
are not allowed to drink, rest of people can get an Alcohol License which will allow you to purchase anything
you want in the authorized stores, if you don't want to get into the (easy) paperwork to get the license, you
can always go have some drinks at a bar or restaurant in a hotel. This was the most shocking change for me as
a Latino, I can't buy beers or rum freely at the supermarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last thing I love about Dubai, it's getting more and more like a science fiction movie, seriously,
I don't know why, but these guys ruling the country have a very futuristic vision. Tallest building
in the world (Burj Khalifa), artificial islands (Palm Jumeirah and the one Burj Al-Arab hotel is built on top
of), biggest shopping mall in the world (The Dubai Mall), they are testing flying taxis already and
there's a project to build a Hyperloop train, that will take you
from Dubai to Abu Dhabi in less than 20min, by bus or car it almost 2hr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working at dubizzle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at a UAE based company, like dubizzle, comes with some perks. But working at one of the most
visited and recognized brands in the country is even better. First of all over 30 different nationalities
converge in the same workplace, different cultural backgrounds. British, Latinos, Indians, Arabs, Pakistanis,
Asians, Europeans, you name it, I sometimes joke with HR everytime I recommend someone from a country we don't have
yet saying "he's a new nationality for out list, we should just hire him to show off" so far we have people from
all of the 5 continents working at dubizzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have an idea of how big dubizzle is, we are now part of the OLX group and dubizzle was the only site within
the region that wasn't re-branded to OLX, we got to keep our name and identity because it was a so well established
brand that it would have been more expensive to re-brand it and rebuild it rather that just keep the same brand
as it is, also, we are the only company running a different stack, all of the OLX sites run on PHP, we run in
python and mostly django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at a place at this scale is great!, you get to solve very complex and interesting problems, such as optimizing
a service to reduce the response time, might be a caching problem or a database issue, you'll have to look
at the data and make a decision on where to start and you'll have complete freedom to get it done within
reasonable deadlines, of course. This is a very data-driven process, before we do anything we look at numbers,
either from an A/B test or one of our monitoring tools like newrelic and we start analyzing what's happening and
thinking how to approach the problem at hand, we sometimes need to build several proof of concepts and measure
to see what would be the best way to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I like the most is how everyone is involved on product decisions, like new features, design or workflow
changes, every idea needs to be presented as a spec, with some sort of numbers backing it, either an A/B test or
a market research, results from a poll, anything to back it idea, all the company is involved in these spec reviews:
Engineering, Customer Support, Sales, Finance, Marketing, Management, literally everyone who wants to attend can
do it. The specs are presented and everyone is encouraged to talk, criticize (in a constructive way), make suggestions,
agree, disagree, the idea is to improve the idea and take it from good to awesome or prevent us from building it
if someone finds a good point that proves the spec wrong or too expensive. Everyone has a voice and everyone's voice
is heard. Anyone can have an idea, spec it and take it to spec review, some of the features in our website came from
some engineer who thought it could work and wrote the spec along with the Product Manager and made it live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as a new parent, flexibility is very important to me, dubizzle is by far one of the most flexible companies
I've worked at, working hours are from 9:00 to 18:00, but you don't need to be in at 9:00 sharp, strictly, if you
can't make it, either because of traffic or because life happened at home, dubizzle is a very goal-oriented workplace,
so, as long as you're in for your daily team stand-up (which starts by 9:45 - 10:00 in my case) or you message in advance
if you're going to be late, it's ok. But, you need to keep in mind that, sometimes, you'll need to make up some time if
your project is getting late and will miss the deadline. I've had to leave early because my wife or my daughter were not
feeling well, had to take one week off in the middle of a sprint because all of us were sick, in bed, had to come in
late because I had to run some errands or take a whole day off to go to the Venezuelan Embassy in Abu Dhabi and I've never
got a no by an answer from my manager, they all know that unplanned issues happen, but, you need to plan for the ones
you know will happen, like visa or passport renewals, medical appointments and that kind of things so your team adds some
buffer time in the sprint, accounting for your time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a dubizzler, also comes with some unexpected perks, as you might imagine already, my name is Israel, and it's
a FAQ in immigration all the time. So, first time I went out of the country and came back, I got a weird look from the
immigration officer and a "please, go to office number 2" as he handed me my passport back. And there I was, with a lot
of long bearded guys waiting for my turn and and Arab guy just calls my name "Israiil?" (which is Arabic for my name),
I approach the counter and the guy starts throwing Arabic to me, and I speak no Arabic, I don't know what he said, but
to me it sounded something like &lt;em&gt;hala mahala hammdulleh hamdu affek hal&lt;/em&gt; I replied with one of the few phrases I know in
Arabic &lt;em&gt;ana la atakalam al-arabiia&lt;/em&gt; which means "I don't speak Arabic", the guy laughed and continued his Arabic monologue,
I had to interrupt him by saying "No, seriously, I don't speak Arabic". So, he started making a lot of routine questions,
"what's your full name?", "where are you from?", "how long are you planning to stay in the UAE?", "how long have you been
living in the UAE?", "where do you live?", "where do you work?", and then, the surprise came. "oh! you work at dubizzle,
it's ok, it's ok, I like dubizzle very much, take you passport, khalas... go, go go... it's ok". Everytime I say I work
at dubizzle, feels like I'm a rockstar and I didn't knew about it, at each and every hackathon or conference I've been to
in the UAE, working at dubizzle inspires some kind of respect, and I'm humbled every time it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A day in the life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at dubizzle, a platform that operates at a huge scale, presents a lot of challenges as a Software Engineer. Everything
we write and deploy to production needs to be extensively tested, it needs to scale well and have proper monitoring and
alerting in place so in case something fails, we are informed by our systems and not by the Customer Support calling the 
on-call number saying an angry user is yelling because something is not working, we have a &lt;em&gt;users comes first&lt;/em&gt; kind of principles,
so everything we do is to give more value to the users and most of out tests are to research how the users are using
our platform and see how we can deliver more value to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, we are migrating the whole platform to a microservices oriented architecture, so, most of today's challenges
are in two fronts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.- Breaking out a legacy monolith into independent, scalable, deployable, and testable services&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.- Building those microservices while keeping a rollback option in case of something horrible happening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we are not facing that dilemma of "should this be a different package?", now it's more "where should I build this?",
we try to keep our services from doing more than one thing, simplicity is the main value now, so far, we've deployed over 70
services and we continue to break the monolith into smaller units, all powered by python and django for our backends and react for
our frontend, running on top of AWS. Does this sound like a place you would like to work at? leave me a comment! and we can talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="middle east"></category><category term="dubizzle"></category></entry><entry><title>New Grads Survival Guide</title><link href="http://iffm.me/new-grads-survival-guide.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-03-25T00:00:00+04:00</published><updated>2016-03-25T00:00:00+04:00</updated><author><name>Israel Fermín Montilla</name></author><id>tag:iffm.me,2016-03-25:/new-grads-survival-guide.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;OK, OK...

reading. I know... I know, we started bad our relationship already but,
I can explain it, I swear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it says "survival guide", but it's not like that, I'm not going to
tell you a recipe to get the job you want, in the company you like and
the country you dream, that's impossible, as programmer we all know
there is no silver bullet, and it applies not only on software, also in
day by day life problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I'm going to share with you, is what worked and still working for
me, let me give you some context. I'm a 29 years old Computer Engineer
from Venezuela, yes, I know... we're famous for good baseball players,
beautiful women and, most recently and sadly, thanks to this guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Hugo Chávez, worst Venezuelan
president..." src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/8v0mswsxcdii5pd/chavez.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this other guy...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Nicolás Maduro... even worse that
Chávez" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2yqy0xbwldnwth4/maduro.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My country is, obviously, a 3rd world country, we're facing huge and
very serious economic and political issues and it's quickly getting
worse thanks to those guys, my family is not rich so I couldn't travel
or go to another country to study until things get better and, by now,
I'm living in Dubai, paying my rent and brought my wife abroad so we
have some hope of having the quality of life we dreamed together, how I
did it?, my job is my flight ticket and my passport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to get out of Caracas, one of the most violent and dangerous
cities in the world, and come to Dubai 2 years ago. Obviously this
wasn't with money from my own pocket, a local company hired me and
covered my relocation expenses. I'm going to share with you some things
I did and still doing, this is not guaranteed to give you the job you
want, but certainly will help you increase your chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Set up a decent LinkedIn profile:&lt;/em&gt; no joke, this helps, a lot of
    recruiters and companies in LinkedIn, don't underestimate that tool,
    it's really powerful and you don't need to pay for the pro or
    premium version. A good LinkedIn profile includes a picture, a
    description of each job you had, and by description I mean
    responsibilities and key achievements and responsibilities in
    that position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a public GitHub account:&lt;/em&gt; and actually &lt;em&gt;use it!&lt;/em&gt;, I'm not
    telling you to contribute to a lot of open source projects or to
    start yet another social auth library, just experiment with new
    tools, build some cool hello-world style projects and upload the
    code to GitHub, this will show that you're actively learning new
    stuff all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have a StackOverflow account:&lt;/em&gt; and, again, &lt;em&gt;use it&lt;/em&gt;, answer some
    questions and ask some questions, it's useful and it will help you,
    trust me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be passionate:&lt;/em&gt; love your career, you studied it for a reason.
    Learn new stuff, experiment with a new language or framework, show
    everybody the cool stuff you're working on, get ideas from other
    people and learn from them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be pragmatic:&lt;/em&gt; yes, when it comes to work, you have to let your
    knowledge and logic guide your decisions, not your emotions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose your weapon:&lt;/em&gt; and do it early, it's good to be versatile,
    you're a programmer, not a user of a programming language. But you
    need a battle ax, the one that helps you solve any problem faster
    and you feel more comfortable with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the one I consider the most important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose your first job carefully:&lt;/em&gt; yes, I mean it, don't let the job
    choose you, you have to enjoy your job because it's where you will
    spend most of the day and, trust me, your first job will define your
    career. If you start developing J2EE applications, people will hire
    you to do so, because that's the experience you have. Don't be
    afraid to say no to an offer you're not totally convinced of taking.
    In my case, when I was looking for an internship, I turned down an
    offer from Microsoft in Venezuela because I've always been an Open
    Source enthusiast and a Linux user, I didn't found myself
    programming in ASP.NET, I decided to take an offer from Vauxoo, a
    local small company that developed open source modules for OpenERP
    (now Odoo) and I'm very happy I took that road, I learned Python in
    that job, which is my battle ax and my main tool by today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... yeah!, not a recipe, but some tips I hope will help you on your
first years as a professional.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="career"></category></entry></feed>
